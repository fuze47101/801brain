# PULSE HYDRATION

Pulse Hydration is a patent-pending hydration adapter system owned under 801, LLC.

## Product Overview

Pulse converts any standard single-thread water bottle (Smartwater, Fiji, Coke, Pepsi bottles — NOT cheap thin Walmart/Dollar-style caps) into a backpack hydration system.

It screws onto the bottle opening and includes:

- Integrated one-way pressure-activated vacuum valve
- Bottle installs upside down in pack
- Hose exits through pack
- 360° silicone bite valve for users with limited articulation
- Includes adapter for 63mm wide-mouth bottles (Nalgene style)

## Positioning

Pulse replaces expensive $50 hydration bladders that:
- Grow mold
- Taste like plastic
- Are hard to clean
- Are not recyclable

Pulse is:
- Eco-friendly
- Reusable
- Uses recyclable bottles
- Low cost
- Simple
- Works with bottles people already own

MSRP: $24.95  
Warehouse landed cost: $5.50  
Inventory: ~2000 units  

## Strategic Goal

Make Pulse the hero product to rebuild Ledge / 801.

Primary channel focus:
- Direct to Consumer
- Online video-driven marketing
- Demonstration-based selling
- Mold comparison campaigns
- Camelbak callout positioning

Retail peg strategy historically weak because product uniqueness is hidden visually.

Online + video = key unlock.

## Expansion Path

Future add-ons:
- Replacement hose kits
- Replacement bite valves
- Upgraded components

Maintain MAP control.

Patent pending only (no issued patent yet).
