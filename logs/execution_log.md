Request: Design a TikTok hook about moldy bladders
Response:
**TikTok Hook Design for Pulse Hydration — Moldy Bladders**

---

### Objective:
Grab attention with a shocking, relatable pain point about traditional hydration bladders, then position Pulse as the clean, mold-free alternative.

---

### Hook Structure:

1. **Visual Shock + Question:**  
_Close-up footage or graphic of a moldy hydration bladder or “mold growing” time lapse_  
**Text on screen + voice-over:**  
“Drink from THIS? Gross... ever wonder what’s really in your hydration bladder?”

2. **Pain Point Callout:**  
Quick cuts showing:  
- Mold inside bladder  
- Someone grimacing after drinking  
- “Mold grows. Plastic tastes awful. Bladders are impossible to clean!” (text + VO)

3. **Tease Solution:**  
Cut to Pulse adapter installed on a clean bottle:  
“Want a mold-free, reusable, eco-friendly hydration upgrade? Meet Pulse—the hydration hack using bottles you already own.”

4. **Call to Action & Brand Cue:**  
“Say goodbye to mold and nasty tastes. Link in bio to ditch your bladder for good!”

---

### Messaging Pillars:

- Mold = gross outrage factor  
- Bladders = hard to clean, plastic taste, expensive  
- Pulse = clean, easy, eco, cheap, reusable with any bottle

---

### Distribution Notes:

- Use trending sounds or quick energetic cuts to match TikTok style  
- Include text captions so it works without sound  
- Encourage UGC engagement: “Show us your moldy bladder and we’ll send you Pulse!” campaign idea

If you want, I can sketch a storyboard or script next.

Project: pulse
Role: cfo
Request: Model /day DTC ramp
Response:
Certainly. To model a direct-to-consumer (DTC) daily ramp for Pulse Hydration, I will factor in:

- Current inventory (2,000 units)
- Warehouse landed cost ($5.50)
- MSRP ($24.95)
- Positioning and marketing strategy (video-driven, mold campaigns, etc.)
- Time horizon for ramp
- Growth assumptions (awareness, conversion rate improvements)
- Capital efficiency & runway constraints (not detailed here, so will assume neutral)
- Risk factors (patent pending, competition)

---

### Step 1: Define Time Horizon & Ramp Duration  
Typical ramp periods for DTC launches:

- Initial launch testing phase: 30 days
- Growth phase: 60 days post-launch ramp
- Maturation: after 90 days

Since inventory = 2,000 units, we need sales to clear or replenish inventory without stockouts.

---

### Step 2: Define Sales Growth Assumptions  

| Metric                  | Value                      | Notes                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Initial daily sales (Day 1) | 10 units                  | Conservative start               |
| Daily sales growth rate  | 10% per day for first 20 days, then plateau | Aggressive video marketing ramp |
| Post-ramp daily sales    | 70 units/day               | Steady state after ramp-up       |

Explanation:  
- Starting modestly to test ads, conversion, social proof  
- 10% daily growth driven by video campaigns and social proof  
- Plateau by ~ Day 20-25 depending on market saturation  

---

### Step 3: Calculate Sales Volume Over Ramp Period (30 days)  

| Day | Daily Sales Units | Cumulative Sales | Inventory Remaining* |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | 10                | 10               | 2,000 - 10 = 1,990  |
| 2    | 11 (10 x 1.1)     | 21               | 1,979               |
| 3    | 12.1              | 33.1             | 1,967               |
| ...  |                   |                  |                     |
| 20   | ~67.3             | ≈ 748            | 1,252               |
| 25   | 70 (plateau)      | ≈ 1,100          | 900                 |
| 30   | 70                | ≈ 1,450          | 550                 |

\* Assuming no replenishment.

Record shows inventory reduces nicely with ramp.

---

### Step 4: Project Revenue & Key Financials  

- **Average selling price (MSRP):** $24.95  
- **Warehouse landed cost:** $5.50  
- **Gross margin:** (24.95 - 5.50) = $19.45 (~78%)  
- **Revenue (30 days):** 1,450 units x $24.95 ≈ $36,152  
- **COGS:** 1,450 units x $5.50 = $7,975  
- **Gross profit:** $28,177  

---

### Step 5: EBITDA / Cash Flow Considerations  

Let's approximate marketing spend:

- CAC target: assume $15 per paid conversion initially  
- Marketing cost: 1,450 x $15 = $21,750  
- EBITDA contribution for 30 days: $28,177 (gross profit) - $21,750 = $6,427  

---

### Step 6: Summary and Recommendations  

| KPI                   | Value                         |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Launch Start Daily Sales | 10 units                    |
| Ramp-up Growth Rate     | 10% per day (first 20 days)  |
| Steady State Sales      | 70 units/day                 |
| 30-day Sales Volume     | ~1,450 units                 |
| 30-day Revenue          | ~$36K                        |
| 30-day Gross Profit     | ~$28K                        |
| 30-day Marketing Spend  | ~$22K                        |
| 30-day EBITDA           | ~$6.4K                       |
| Inventory Remaining 30d | ~550 units                   |

---

### Step 7: Strategic Implications  

- **Inventory:** At current ramp, inventory lasts >1 month. Consider reorder or quick restock based on demand signals.  
- **Video-driven campaigns** critical to hit ramp growth assumptions (10% daily growth).  
- **Customer feedback & reviews** important early to sustain growth and reduce CAC over time.  
- **MAP enforcement** to maintain price integrity for profitability.  
- **Future add-ons** potential to extend lifetime value (LTV), improving ROI and exit valuation.  
- **Monitor patent risk and competitive responses** to guard IP moat and maintain positioning.

If you want, I can also build a detailed weekly or monthly ramp model or include different scenarios (conservative, base, aggressive). Would you like that?
